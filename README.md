## Background
Image restoration is a significant research direction in image processing, aiming to recover the original quality of degraded images through computational methods. Traditional approaches rely on manually designed features, which are often ineffective in handling diverse scenarios. In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods has brought revolutionary advancements to image restoration. Techniques ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generative adversarial networks (GANs) enable automatic feature extraction, addressing critical challenges such as denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Current research focuses on the application of visual Transformers, the adoption of self-supervised learning, and innovative uses of generative models in image restoration. These technologies find widespread applications in old photo restoration, medical image enhancement, satellite image processing, and more, providing robust support for both research and practical applications. 
## Goal
•	Apply different methods for image pre-processing. \
•	Apply several pre-trained diffusion models (text & image to image). \
•	Testing the performance of a denoising diffusion CNN-based U-Net model with images from different pre-processing methods.
